<hr />
<h3>Phantom Thread</h3>
<p>A beautiful love story that unfolds like a shakespearian play, from the dialogue to the subtle placement of ghost like figures, this movie knows how to enthrall you and is a unique take on what defines a relationship and how that relationship evolves.
</p>
<h3>After Sun</h3>
<p>What starts out as a meandering moment in time about a father and daugher, slowly develops into how influential your parents are in your life and how deeply sad it can be to never truly reveal who you are to the people that matter to you the most.  It is heart breaking, beautiful and bitter sweet and it captures a moment in time that strikes a nostalgic cord for that maternal love one yearns from knowing their parents on a deeper level</p>
<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>A horror movie masked as a family drama, the unraveling of a family, plagued by the darkness within, and how old rituals never truly die, they are simply born again</p>
